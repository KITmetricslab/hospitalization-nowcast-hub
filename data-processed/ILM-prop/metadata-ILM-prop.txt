methods: Weekly proportions of hospitalziatons by age-group
data_inputs: RKI
methods_long: "Within every age group we calculate the proportion of the seven-day \
  \ case incidence that appear in the seven-day hospitalization incidence after a delay of \
  \ one, two, three and four weeks. Using these proportions and the current incidence two days \
  \ in the past, we predict the amount of hospitalizations within every age group. \
  \ Prediction intervals are obtained by fitting a log-normal distribution to past predictions of our model. \
  \ Summing the point predictions over all age-groups yields predictions for all hospitalizations. \
  \ Prediction intervals for these are obtained by a similar procedure assuming \
  \ a normal distribution for predictions."
